					<h2>Keep Your Virtual Phone Number Safe With These Tips</h2>
					<p>Keeping your virtual phone number safe is as easy as taking the normal precautions that you would with your social media account or regular cell number. By doing this, you can prevent a variety of hacks and fraudsters from accessing your personal details.</p>
					<p>First, you need to make sure your phone and Internet service are both fast and reliable. In addition, you should always keep your data limits in check and avoid letting them exceed the maximum.</p>
